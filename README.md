TechnicalDifficulties is the sample code for the blog post [Getting To Grips With The Core Media IO Camera Extension, a 3 part series, part 2 of 3: Creating an useful software Core Media Camera Extension, interprocess communication, and painless debugging](https://theoffcuts.org/posts/core-media-io-camera-extensions-part-two/), from [The Offcuts](https://www.theoffcuts.org).

You can also check out the [sample code for part 1](https://github.com/Halle/OffcutsCam), and the [sample code for part 3](https://github.com/Halle/ArtFilm). They are all iterations of the same CMIO Camera Extension, with an increasing featureset.
